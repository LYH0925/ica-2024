This is my first independent research project. I used deep learning for text classification and analysis to study comments on Chinese social media about the 'anti-Chinese medicine' topic. I calculated analytical thinking scores and created some initial visualizations.

Here is a brief description of each file:  
- **LIWC_result.xlsx**: Contains the results of text analysis on the comments, used to calculate analytical thinking scores.  
- **Classification_demo.ipynb**: The main code for text classification.  
- **Data analysis in LIWC.R**: Code for data visualization using R.  
- **Xlsx_2_csv.ipynb**: Code for converting Excel files to CSV format.
